# J6

J6 = JSiX - the Java SImple programming eXtensions library

I collected my ideas of solving common issues in Java in this repository
according to the rule "Do not repeat yourself" over years.

Some of the contents are clearly based on solutions googled from 3rd party sources,
and I tried to reference them direcly in the code to give appropriate credit to authors.
If you find that something here is yours and I forgot to mention you as the source,
please let me know, I will do my best to solve the issue as soon as possible.
